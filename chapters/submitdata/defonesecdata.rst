Definitive 1-Second Data
========================

.. include:: ../../shared/variables.rst

Since 2014 INTERMAGNET has requested observatories to provide
1-second definitive data if they are able to do so. Calls for
1-second definitive data will be made at the same time as calls
for 1-minute definitive data. It is not a requirement of
INTERMAGNET membership that an observatory is able to provide
1-second data. Where possible, observatories should produce
data that complies with the INTERMAGNET 1-second data standard
(see :numref:`Chapter %s <1sec_imo>`). At present observatories
are requested to provide baseline corrected 1-second definitive
data whether or not it conforms to the standard, though
this is likely to change in the future as more observatories
become able to meet the standard.
INTERMAGNET is currently developing recommendations on how to produce 
1-second definitive data that will conform to the standard.

INTERMAGNET has created a format for 1-second data (see
|app_cdf|) based on NASAâ€™s Common Data Format (CDF)
software. Observatories are asked to supply data in the new
INTERMAGNET CDF format. Software for conversion to the new
format is available. For the most up to date details of what
software is available please see |imag_software|
