Submission of Quasi-Definitive Data
====================================

.. include:: ../../shared/variables.rst

An observatory sends quasi-definitive data to its assigned GIN
via e-mail or web upload. The best way to do this is to use the
IAGA-2002 data format. INTERMAGNET encourages observatories to
send quasi-definitive data as soon as possible.
Quasi-definitive data should be sent within 3 months after
their acquisition.
