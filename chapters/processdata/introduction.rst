Introduction
============

Quality control methods should be employed in the production of
reported, adjusted and definitive data. Total field intensity
values that are recorded using a proton precession magnetometer
are an excellent tool for monitoring the measurement process
that produces component values. The total field values may also
be used to estimate the maximum likely range of error for
component values. Baseline values are used to adjust component
values for long-period, non-random error. A baseline adoption
process may be used that provides confidence limits for
component 1-minute and 1-second values. A tabular listing of
annual baseline values and a description of baseline
adjustments accompany the absolute data contained on
INTERMAGNET DVDs/CD-ROMs. A graphic display of baselines and
differences in computed and recorded total field values are
available to users for stations on the INTERMAGNET
DVDs/CD-ROMs.
