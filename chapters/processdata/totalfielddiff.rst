The Computation of Total Field Differences
==========================================

Whenever possible, observatories should measure the scalar
field intensity S (:numref:`sub_dat_intro_gc`) in addition to the vector
components of the magnetic field. The total field component F
(:numref:`sub_dat_intro_gc`) can be calculated from the vector components of
the field using simple mathematical relationships. F and S thus
provide two independent values of the total field intensity
from two different instruments at different locations within
the observatory. Calculating the difference between these two
values (F - S) is a powerful tool for quality control of the
magnetic time series data.

Where both instruments are stable and functioning correctly the
value (F - S) is expected to be a constant (within the noise
envelope of the instrumentation) and by accounting for the
difference in the magnetic field between the two locations
where F and S are measured the (F-S) value can be reduced to
close to zero. Any variations in the value of (F - S) which are
beyond the expected noise envelope of the two instruments can
indicate contamination or instability in either the vector or
scalar instrument. (F - S) is often the only measure of the
vector variometer baseline stability during the periods between
absolute observations.

The (F - S) value can be computed from adjusted,
quasi-definitive or definitive 1 minute or 1-second data and
used to monitor data quality and instrument stability as part
of routine daily quality checks.

The value of this technique as a quality control tool is
diminished when the calculated total field (F) is dominated by
one component of the magnetic field. In this case changes in F
can be relative insensitive to the component which contributes
least to the value of F.
