Producing Quasi-Definitive Data
===============================

.. include:: ../../appendices/appendices.rst


The production of quasi-definitive data is generally similar to
the process described here for definitive data, the difference
being that quasi-definitive data should be sent within 3 months
after their acquisition. Quasi-definitive data are produced
using the best available baselines at the time of production,
providing these data meet the quality specification of
quasi-definitive data as given in |app_imag_term|. Observatories
are likely to adopt the same process to produce
quasi-definitive data as they do for definitive data as this
simplifies the production of definitive data at the end of the
year. Example methods of quasi-definitive production adopted by
some institutes are listed in :numref:`sub_dat_qd_data_ref`.
