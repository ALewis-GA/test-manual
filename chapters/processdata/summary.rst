Summary
=======

Tools that might be used for quality control of reported,
adjusted and definitive data have briefly been described.
INTERMAGNET is establishing standards of comparison such as the
graphs of baselines and F-P values. Participating observatories
may evaluate the performance of their operations relative to
the results of other observatories. Participants communicate
with other members on instrumentation procedures to improve the
quality of INTERMAGNET observatory data.
