The INTERMAGNET Principles and Conditions
=========================================

INTERMAGNET is operated according to principles and conditions
(listed below) which are accepted as necessary and desirable
for maintaining a service of rapid magnetic observatory data
exchanges for the international scientific community and for
commercial users.

#. INTERMAGNET is a non-exclusive program of worldwide data
   exchange between magnetic observatories.

#. An INTERMAGNET aim is the establishment and maintenance of
   observatories in remote areas where local support is
   lacking.

#. INTERMAGNET encourages the establishment and maintenance of
   digital observatories in developing countries, with the
   involvement and enhancement of local science and technology.

#. Each participating country/institution is expected to bear
   the costs of its participation in INTERMAGNET.

#. Data will be transmitted from observatories or operating
   institutes to regional geomagnetic information nodes (GINs)
   by satellites, computer networks or by other near real-time
   means, using standard INTERMAGNET formats.

#. Regional geomagnetic information nodes will exchange data
   and data products globally as rapidly as appropriate, and
   will maintain data files for all contributing observatories
   for a period commensurate with the immediate usefulness of
   the product.

#. The collected data will be made available to the scientific
   community and to participating observatories on the
   INTERMAGNET web site or on media and in formats approved by
   the INTERMAGNET Executive Council.

#. All data are supplied on the condition that they are not
   used for commercial gain (media, transcription and other
   costs may be charged to the user).

#. The INTERMAGNET Executive Council recognizes the value to
   commerce of geomagnetic data and derived products which are
   available in near real-time, and accepts the right of
   participating institutions to recover costs for services and
   to levy charges where possible and as necessary.
   Participating institutions will undertake to safeguard the
   interests of fellow participants concerning the commercial
   usage of their data.

#. Each INTERMAGNET GIN will provide annually to each
   participating institution or observatory a statement of data
   received by the GIN. Each week, INTERMAGNET will provide
   data download statistics to the community.



#. Participating institutes will co-operate to facilitate the
   production of globally representative data products, such as
   the official IAGA indices.

#. Participating institutions will agree to submit definitive
   data annually for inclusion in the INTERMAGNET data set.
