Values of geomagnetic components along with other INTERMAGNET
products may be retrieved from the website
(|intermagnet_website|)
under Data. Values are kept on-line permanently to allow
comparisons between preliminary and definitive data and to give
data sets that can be used to test software that works with
preliminary data. When available, definitive data should
preferably be used. Before 2017, a physical media containing
definitive data from INTERMAGNET observatories was created
annually. After 2016, definitive data will not be published on
a physical media and will be available for download on the
INTERMAGNET website. The INTERMAGNET physical medias are
available at no charge to participating institutes and to bona
fide scientists for academic purposes only. Technical help for
operators of IMOs may also be available by special arrangements
through the INTERMAGNET office.
