Environment/Location
====================

There are a number of factors that determine the quality of
data recorded at an observatory and whether the recorded data
conform to the INTERMAGNET standards for one-second data. Such
factors include the types of instrument, the operating
environment, the quality and frequency of absolute observations
and the method used to apply baseline measurements to the
vector magnetometer data.

The instrument's operating environment varies greatly from
observatory to observatory, but generally, vector magnetometers
must be housed in a clean, dry, shelter with a stable pillar
(preferably on bed rock), where there is low magnetic gradient
and no man-made magnetic contamination. Since in general,
vector magnetometers have a significant temperature
coefficient, the vector magnetometer shelter should ideally
maintain a constant temperature throughout the year as well as
protecting the instrument from the elements. This may be
achieved through thermal insulation and damping and may also
include regulated heating or cooling.

Generally, scalar magnetometers, have an extremely small
temperature coefficient and may be housed in non-temperature
regulated housing, but they must still be protected from the
elements. Instruments should be separated by a few meters to
avoid cross-contamination.

The Manual on Magnetic Measurements and Observatory Practice
(Jankowski and Sucksdorff, 1996) suggests establishing a
magnetic observatory on a piece of land which is large enough
not only to house the buildings, but also to limit the magnetic
contamination from surrounding infrastructure or activity. In
order to resolve the long period components of the natural
magnetic field, care must be taken to select a site that is
free from sources of man-made magnetic contamination over
time-scales of many years. Contamination can come from nearby
roads, buildings, power distribution infrastructure
(transformers or cables), transmitters (radio or
communication), local land use (e.g. housing, farm machinery,
etc.) or from electric train lines. DC train lines can cause
interference for tens of kilometers.

Other factors for consideration are:

-   The site should offer good visibility to distant target(s)
    to be used as an horizontal direction reference in absolute
    observations.
-   The observatory buildings should be located on a flat,
    well-drained, solid foundation. Buildings, lighting and
    heating systems should be made of non-magnetic materials.
    Electricity supplies to variometer and absolute buildings
    for lighting and heating should be AC.
-   There should be access to a reliable mains electricity
    supply to the site, preferably with some form of back-up
    power, so that power outages are kept to a minimum.
-   The site should offer good visibility to distance reference
    objects for absolute observations.
-   There should be access to local telephone or network
    communications for data transfer.
-   There should be an existing clean, dry environment nearby to
    house the data recording equipment.
-   The site should be easily accessible by observatory staff.
