Because of recent developments in instrumentation, data
acquisition, and data dissemination, an increasing number of
observatories have begun to produce a filtered one-second data
product in addition to traditional one-minute data, hourly
means, daily means, monthly means, and annual means. An
INTERMAGNET survey of the user community carried out in 2005
concluded that there is a desire for one-second data, that they
should be made available through the INTERMAGNET network, and
that, as is the case for one-minute data, a standard of
instrument performance and data quality should be set. The
INTERMAGNET Observatories & Standards Subcommittee has
developed one-second data standards which were adopted in
2012 [#]_ . These standards are discussed in the following
sections.

A one-second INTERMAGNET Magnetic Observatory (1s-IMO) is a
magnetic observatory with full absolute control, making
continual data recordings at a minimum rate of once per second
using a vector magnetometer and at a minimum rate of once every
30 seconds using a scalar magnetometer. Since vector
measurements performed by a continually recording magnetometer
are typically variation measurements, they are to be corrected
to quasi-absolute using the best available baseline
measurements prior to transmission.

1s-IMOs are required to transmit preliminary data in an
INTERMAGNET recognized format (see section 6.1.1) to one of the INTERMAGNET
Geomagnetic Information Nodes (GIN) by electronic means within
72 hours of recording. Data are typically transmitted over the
Internet such that preliminary data can be made available on
the INTERMAGNET web site. Note that, for the time being, GINs
also accept reported data from observatories that have
historically transmitted such data.

Within 3-months, observatories may transmit quasi-definitive
data to one of the INTERMAGNET GINs provided these data meet
the provisional baseline conditions outlined in |app_imag_term|.
Quasi-definitive data submission is by the same method as
preliminary data submission (described in :numref:`sub_dat_prel_data`).
Observatories may submit quasi-definitive data in place of
preliminary data if this meets the requirement of being
received within 72 hours of recording.

At the end of a calendar year, until the production of a global
one-second data archive, one-second data are to be prepared
using final baselines and submitted as definitive data for
inclusion in the INTERMAGNET archive. The deadline for
submission will be communicated by INTERMAGNET. Definitive data
archives are made available on the INTERMAGNET web site. For
definitive data processing, it is recommended that the same
variometer baselines computed for the one minute be used for
the one second, if the same variometer is producing both data
sets.

An observatory intending to participate in INTERMAGNET as a
1sIMO must agree to these conditions for data transmission and
be able to meet the INTERMAGNET standards for one-second data
detailed in this chapter. :numref:`Chapter %s <mem_part>` provides
instruction for observatories wishing to make a 1s-IMO application.
Further information is also available from the INTERMAGNET
Observatories Subcommittee chair.
