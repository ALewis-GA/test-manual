Data Quality Control
====================

Variometer drift should be monitored regularly through frequent
absolute observations. :numref:`Chapter %s <abs_mes>` describes absolute
measurements and :numref:`Chapter %s <proc_dat>`  describes the derivation of
continuous variometer baselines from spot measurements and the calculation of
baseline corrected data.

Continual recordings of the variometer temperature should also
be made as temperature recordings can be of benefit when
determining the source of baseline variations. Many
observatories monitor both the variometer electronics and
sensor separately as the electronics and the sensor typically
have differing temperature coefficients.

Although the use of a continually recording scalar magnetometer
is not mandatory, it is highly recommended. Since proton
precession magnetometers and Overhauser effect magnetometers
generally have a very low temperature coefficient and output
near-absolute values without the need for baseline
measurements, they provides a high quality reference data set
against which baseline-corrected vector variometer data can be
compared, albeit only the scalar component. Such comparisons
can identify baseline drift in the variometer or changes in the
local field gradient. In addition, as the variometer and the
scalar magnetometer are spatially separated, such comparisons
can also serve to identify local magnetic contamination.

The first derivative of the variometer and scalar data can be a
good indicator for spikes and noise. Where there is another
observatory in relatively close proximity, comparisons of the
two sets of vector data can frequently highlight scaling or
alignment errors and also steps, spikes or drifting in a
variometer data set that are not necessarily evident when
observing a single data set.

It is good practice to maintain good written records of
instrument changes, site changes or changes in personnel. Where
there is a major change of instrument that differs
significantly from the original IMO application, this should be
communicated to the INTERMAGNET secretary.
