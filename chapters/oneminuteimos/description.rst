An INTERMAGNET Magnetic Observatory (IMO) is a magnetic
observatory with full absolute control, making continual data
recordings at a minimum rate of one minute. One minute magnetic
field values should be measured using a vector magnetometer
and, optionally, a scalar magnetometer. Vector measurements
performed by a continually recording magnetometer are typically
variation measurements and variation data, transmitted as
reported data, can be accepted by INTERMAGNET GINs from
existing member observatories. However, it has been considered
best practice since Technical Manual V4.0 (1999) that
variometer data are corrected to near absolute values using the
best available baseline estimates at the time of transmission.
Observatories making new applications for INTERMAGNET
membership will be required to transmit data with best
available baseline estimates applied.

IMOs are required to transmit preliminary data in an
INTERMAGNET recognized format to one of the INTERMAGNET
Geomagnetic Information Nodes (GIN) by electronic means within
72 hours of recording. Data are typically transmitted over the
Internet or through satellite such that preliminary data can be
made available on the INTERMAGNET web site. Note that, for the
time being, GINs also accept reported data from observatories
that have historically transmitted such data.

Within 3-months, observatories may transmit quasi-definitive
data to one of the INTERMAGNET GINs provided these data meet
the provisional baseline conditions outlined in |app_imag_term| .
Quasi-definitive data submission is by the same method as
preliminary data submission (described in :numref:`sub_dat_prel_data`).
Observatories may submit quasi-definitive data in place of
preliminary data if this meets the requirement of being
received within 72 hours of recording, but ideally faster (see
:numref:`sub_dat_intro_rtpd`).

At the end of a calendar year, data are to be prepared using
final baselines and submitted as definitive data for inclusion
on the INTERMAGNET DVD. The deadline for submission will be
communicated by INTERMAGNET. Definitive data published on the
DVD are also made available on the INTERMAGNET web site.

An observatory intending to participate in INTERMAGNET as an
IMO must be able to meet the INTERMAGNET standards for
one-minute data detailed below and agree to the conditions for
data transmission detailed in the INTERMAGNET Participation
Policy. The Participation Policy is included in :numref:`Chapter %s <mem_part>`
along with instruction for observatories wishing to make an IMO
application. Further information is also available from the
INTERMAGNET Observatories Subcommittee chair.
