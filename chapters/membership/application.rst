Any observatory wishing to become a member of the INTERMAGNET
network is invited to submit an application to the INTERMAGNET
Operations Committee along with a minimum of twelve months of
one-minute definitive data. The Committee will assess an
application against the data quality standards as described in
this manual (:numref:`Chapter %s <1min_imo>` and
:numref:`Chapter %s <1sec_imo>`) before granting INTERMAGNET membership.

Observatories submitting an application should note that a
condition of acceptance is that the observatory agrees to
comply with the INTERMAGNET Observatory Participation Policy as
described below.

Applications forms are available on the `INTERMAGNET web site`and
forms should be sent to the IMO Applications and Standards
Subcommittee chair:

It is not a prerequisite of INTERMAGNET membership that an
observatory makes one-second recordings nor is it currently a
prerequisite that one-second recordings meet the INTERMAGNET
One-second Definitive Data Standard in order to be transmitted
to INTERMAGNET. Please contact the IMO Applications and
Standards Subcommittee chair for further information.

The IMO Applications and Standards Subcommittee chair can also
be contacted at any stage of the application process for
further information on the application form, data transmission
or for assistance in producing the data files listed on the
