Variometer Operations
=====================

INTERMAGNET recommends:

#. Operating two variometers at the observatory and comparing
   their data records as often as data are downloaded so that
   problems are noticed and can be rectified as soon as
   possible.
#. Keeping variometers, interconnecting cables, and control
   electronics at constant temperatures.
#. Monitoring continually and recording the temperatures of all
   sensors, cables, and electronics units.
