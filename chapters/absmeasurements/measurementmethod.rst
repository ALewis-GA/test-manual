Measurement Method
==================

This manual will not describe how to make absolute
observations. This information is given in two comprehensive
manuals that every magnetic observatory should have:

-  Guide for Magnetic Repeat Station Surveys Newitt, Barton,
   and Bitterly (1996), and the
-  Guide for Magnetic Measurements and Observatory Practice
   Jankowski and Sucksdorff (1996).

Additional information can be found in Wienert (1970) and
Stuart (1984).
