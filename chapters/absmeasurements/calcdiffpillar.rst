Calculation of the Difference Between F Pillar and Absolute Pillar
===================================================================

If :math:`F_v` is the magnetude of the magnetic vector at the
primary absolute pillar, and :math:`p = F_v-F_s` is the
constant magnetic vector difference between the primary pillar
and auxiliary pillar used to measure scalar F, then:

.. math::

    F_v^2 - F_s^2 = (F_s + p) . (F_s+p) - F_s.F_s = 2 F_s . p + p.p


If we set :math:`F_s = F_s^0 +  δ` , where :math:`F_s^0`
is constant typical value and the δ is time-dependent variation :

.. math::

    F_v^2 - F_s^2 &=  2 F_s^0 . p + p.p + 2δ.p\ or \\
   (F_v - F_s)(F_v + F_s) &= (2 F_s^0.p + p.p) + 2 δ.p


:math:`F_v-F_s` is the scalar pier difference at any
moment in time. The variable terms are :math:`(F_v+F_s)` and 2δ.p.
In some situations, such
as auroral observatories on highly-magnetic volcanic rock, δ
and/or p may be large, and :math:`F_v-F_s` may show a
measureable variation. In this case a simple scalar pier
correction is not sufficient. This can be tested by measuring
the total field at both locations for some time with some
variation in δ. If there is no variation in
:math:`F_v-F_s` outside the measurement noise then a
simple scalar correction is acceptable. Otherwise a vector pier
correction needs to be determined and applied. The simplest
determination of p is by direct vector measurement using
variometer corrections. If this is not possible or convenient,
then it may be possible to determine p by a multi-linear
regression of :math:`(F_v^2 - F_s^2)` against δ as measured by a variometer.

The application of this vector pier correction then requires
reasonably calibrated variometer data to remove the first order
changes in :math:`F_v-F_s`.
