Training
========

There are several opportunities for improving techniques and
basic training in absolute measurements. IAGA workshops on
Geomagnetic Observatory Instruments, Data Acquisition and
Processing are held biannually.

Observatory groups may establish inter-observatory absolute
instrument comparisons, similar to the concept of the
Scandinavian inter-observatory comparisons. These activities
also encourage the exchange of ideas on instrumentation and
observatory practice.

Regularly review the observatory procedures, including those in
use for absolute measurements, and consider if they can be
improved.

Provide meaningful information to observers about how their
work contributes to local and worldwide research projects, and
how baseline quality can affect the research. Provide regular
feedback on the quality of absolute observations to observers.
