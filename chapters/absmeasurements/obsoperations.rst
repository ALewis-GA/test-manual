Observatory Operations
======================

INTERMAGNET recommends:

#. Making weekly absolute observations, avoiding intervals of
   magnetic activity. If any baselines are changing rapidly
   increase the frequency of observations.
#. Making regular physical inspections of all observatory
   buildings to ensure that no magnetic materials which would
   cause jumps in baselines are present, inside or outside the
   absolute or variometer buildings.
#. Ensuring that absolute instruments and their supporting
   piers are free from contaminating magnetic materials.
#. Establishing an external-reference-site in an undisturbed
   area outside the absolute building; determining the absolute
   vector difference between that site and the main absolute
   pier. INTERMAGNET recommends annual comparison to check for
   magnetic contamination of either site. The
   external-reference-site may be a permanent pier, or a tripod
   site. If a tripod site is used, the location of the absolute
   instruments must be repeatable in latitude, longitude and
   height. The relocation precision depends on the distance to
   the azimuth mark and on the magnetic gradients at the site.
   Aim for a precision of 1mm in all three coordinates.
#. Ensuring that piers and azimuth marks are physically stable.
   Do not lean on piers during observations.
#. Comparing periodically the angles between multiple
   (non-collinear) azimuth marks to check that both the pier
   and marks are stable. If there is any change in any of the
   angles redetermine the azimuth to the primary azimuth mark
   independently (by means of astronomical observation, or
   differential-GPS for example). INTERMAGNET recommends annual
   checks.
#. Maintaining an up-to-date diary of absolute measurements,
   visits, repairs and other actions at the observatory.
#. Periodically reviewing procedures for absolute observations
   and adopting best practices; this may be facilitated by
   visiting other institutes and by attending the biannual IAGA
   observatory workshop.
