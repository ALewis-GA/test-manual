INTERMAGNET WEB Site
====================
.. include:: ../../shared/variables.rst

The INTERMAGNET web site provides background information about
INTERMAGNET, its structure, and its participating
organizations, countries and IMOs (INTERMAGNET Magnetic
Observatories). The web site offers access to various products
including magnetograms and data files of reported and adjusted
minute values from all the IMOs, the annual CD-ROM/DVD/USB
drive of definitive data, and the Technical Reference Manual.
The INTERMAGNET application form can also be obtained from the
web site.

The web site has been designed around the core of the Web
Experience Toolkit
( |web_toolkit|). The toolkit
focuses on creating an easy-to-use experience for new
technologies (smart phones and tablets) while making it
accessible to the physically impaired. It is designed around
the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guideline.
The content can be navigated with only a keyboard or read with
screen readers, often used by the visually impaired.

Download Data
-------------

Geomagnetic observatory data can be downloaded using a web
browser. The availability of data files is dependent on the
publishing delay of participating institutes. If there is no
publishing delay, data are available within 10 to 20 minutes
after being placed on the server. The data covers the period
from 1991 to present. A number of different data types are
available at several sampling rates and in various formats. For
further details and to download data, see the following web
site: |download_data|

Observatory Plots
-----------------

Plots of magnetic observatory data and information derived from
the data are also available. These include:

-  Plots of X, Y, Z magnetic field components
-  Plots of H, D, Z magnetic field components
-  Plots of declination and inclination
-  Plots of rate of change of the magnetic field (dB/dt)

See the following web page to view these plots: |obs_plots|

Geomagnetic Activity
--------------------

The magnetic activity maps show the range of the magnetic
variation in each hour at INTERMAGNET observatories around the
world. For recent events only those observatories with fast
reporting capabilities are shown. See the following web page to
view these maps:  |geo_act|
