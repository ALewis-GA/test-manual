INTERMAGNET WEB Site
====================
.. include:: ../../shared/variables.rst

The INTERMAGNET web site provides background information about
INTERMAGNET, its structure, and its participating
organizations, countries and IMOs (INTERMAGNET Magnetic
Observatories).
The web site offers access to various products:

* The annual definitive data published with a
  Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
* The magnetograms and data files of reported and adjusted
  minute values from all the IMOs.
* The Technical Reference Manual.
* The INTERMAGNET application form.

The website has been designed using  GitHub Pages (|git_hub_pages|).
INTERMAGNET moved away from inhouse maintained servers towards
free cloud based possibilities.

Downloading Data
----------------

Geomagnetic observatory data can be downloaded using a web browser by either using DOIs for definitive data or 
using the web data distribution interface for all data types including definitive data.
Until 2015, the annual definitive data was released on a physical media (see :numref:`sub_dat_1min_data_enc_soft`).
From 2014 onward, the intermagnet definitive data is published yearly with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which includes 
all definitive data since 1991 to the publication year.

The reference to the downloadable data can be found on the INTERMAGNET website : |def_data|.
The data structure within the compressed file is the same as the INTERMAGNET Physical Media structure.
The downloaded data can be viewed using the IMCDview software which is available
and explained at this location : |imag_software_bgs|.
Reported and adjusted intermagnet data are available in near real-time.
The availability of data files is dependent on the
publishing delay of participating institutes. If there is no
publishing delay, data are available within 10 to 20 minutes
after being placed on the server. The data covers the period
from 1991 to present. A number of different data types are
available at several sampling rates and in various formats. For
further details and to download data, see the following web
site: |download_plot_data|

Observatory Plots
-----------------

Plots of magnetic observatory data and information derived from
the data are also available. These include:

-  Plots of X, Y, Z magnetic field components
-  Plots of H, D, Z magnetic field components
-  Plots of declination and inclination

Geomagnetic Activity
--------------------

The magnetic activity maps show the range of the magnetic
variation in each hour at INTERMAGNET observatories around the
world. For recent events only those observatories with fast
reporting capabilities are shown. The activity map is
currently under development.
