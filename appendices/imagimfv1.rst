--------

Magnetic data, with tenth-nanotesla resolution, are organized on a day
file basis. One file contains 24 one-hour blocks, each containing 60
minutes worth of values. Blocks of 60 minutes of data are transmitted.
Blocks are padded with 9's if incomplete. Information is coded in ASCII.

File name: To remain compatible with all operating systems, the file
name is limited to 8 characters and will contain the date and the
three-letter code as an extension. eg: MAR1591.BOU for Boulder, March
15, 1991; and JUN2391.OTT for June 23, 1991 at Ottawa.
